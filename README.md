## Description

**Gomoku<sup>1</sup>**, also known as **Wuziqi<sup>2</sup>**, **Omok<sup>3</sup>**, **Caro<sup>4</sup>**, **Luffarschack<sup>5</sup>**, or simply **Five in a Row**, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a 15×15 Go board, although boards of other sizes are also common. In variants like Caro and Luffarschack, the game is usually played on a sheet of squared paper using Xs and Os, similar to Tic-Tac-Toe.

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. Black plays first. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken line of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board is completely filled and no one has made a line of five stones, the game ends in a draw.
